# do动词特例:have/has

---

## 自然推理
### 推理have/has的词义及用法

1. I have an iPhone. 
2. You have nice lips. 
3. He has big eyes.
4. She has a white dog.
5. It has four arms.
6. They have a beautiful house.
7. We have a good teacher.

- have /hæv/和has /hæz/均为“有”、“拥有”的意思。 
- have在单三形式下变为has

### 判断哪些词为不可数名词以及哪些词可以用来修饰不可数名词

1. He has a lot of money. 
2. I have too much homework. 
3. We have only a few books. 
4. We have only a little water. 
5. She wants some oranges and sugar.

不可数： 

- money 集合了纸币、硬币、电子货币等在内的集体概念 
- homework 包括各类练习题在内的集体概念 
- 同理work也不可数 
- sugar为小颗粒状，故不可数

可修饰不可数名词的形容词：
1. a lot of / lots of 皆可 
2. much 不可数 many 可数 
3. a few可数 a little 不可数 
4. some 皆可

# 副词
英文中很多adj.词尾加上-ly后就可以变为adv.

- quick → quickly 
- bad → badly 
- happy → happily 以-y结尾的adj.是去y加-ily 
- clear → clearly

一些副词并非以-ly结尾，且习惯上并非所有副词都能用来同时修饰动词、形容词和其它副词。 


1. 不修饰动词的副词
- very
- so 如此 （音标课里的so是“所以”之意）
- too

2. 仅修饰动词的副词
- very much
- so much
- a lot
- now

3. 动词、形容词、副词皆可修饰的副词
- really
- only

比如：
1. Thank you very much/ so much.或者Thanks a lot. 不说Very thank you.
2. I really like it! 不说I very like it.
3. He speaks very clearly.不说He speaks clearly very much.

## 实践
1. she, speak, only, few/little, English 
2. he, have, so, many/much, orange
3. I, see, 6, people, clear
4. Mr. Charles /tʃa:lz/, sing, song, sad
5. father, work, real, hard

完整句子如下: 

1. She speaks only a little English. 
2. He has so many oranges. 
3. I see six people clearly. 
4. Mr. Charles sings songs sadly. 
5. Father works really hard.
